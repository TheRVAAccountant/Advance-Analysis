# Pivot Table Restoration with Enhanced Debugging

## Overview
Restored the pivot table creation functionality with modifications to use the 'Advance/Prepayment' column instead of 'UDO', while adding comprehensive debugging and logging.

## Changes Made

### 1. Column Search Update
- Changed from searching for "UDO" to searching for "Advance/Prepayment" column
- Searches for columns containing both "advance" and "prepayment" (case-insensitive)
- Falls back to any column containing balance-related keywords if not found

### 2. Pivot Table Creation with Debugging
The code now attempts to create a proper pivot table with enhanced logging:

```python
# Steps performed:
1. Log the data range and destination cell
2. Create pivot cache with logging
3. Create pivot table with logging
4. List all available pivot fields for debugging
5. Add the Advance/Prepayment field to the pivot table
6. Apply formatting
```

### 3. Fallback Mechanism
If pivot table creation fails for any reason:
- Logs the specific error
- Falls back to creating a manual SUM formula
- Ensures the calculation is always created

### 4. Enhanced Logging
Added detailed logging at each step:
- Data range address
- Pivot table destination
- Available pivot fields in the table
- Success/failure of each operation
- Specific error messages with full context

## Benefits

1. **Preserves Functionality**: Keeps the original pivot table functionality intact
2. **Better Debugging**: Comprehensive logging helps identify exactly where and why failures occur
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to SUM formula if pivot table fails
4. **Flexible Column Matching**: Works with various column name formats

## Expected Log Output

```
Searching for Advance/Prepayment column...
Found Advance/Prepayment column at index 5 (column E): 'Advance/Prepayment'
Using column 'Advance/Prepayment' for pivot table
Creating pivot table...
Pivot table data range: $A$6:$H$14
Pivot table destination: Cell I6 (column 9)
Pivot cache created successfully
Pivot table created successfully
Available pivot fields:
  Field 1: TAS
  Field 2: SGL
  Field 3: DHS Doc No
  ...
  Field 5: Advance/Prepayment
Adding 'Advance/Prepayment' field to pivot table values...
Successfully set pivot field orientation and function
Pivot table created successfully with sum in cell $I$7
```

## Troubleshooting

If the pivot table still fails, the logs will show:
1. Exact error message when accessing PivotFields
2. List of available fields (if accessible)
3. Which method failed (direct property setting vs AddDataField)
4. The fallback action taken

This information will help identify if the issue is:
- Field name mismatch
- Data range problems
- Excel COM automation limitations
- Permission or protection issues
