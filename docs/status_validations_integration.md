# Status Validations Integration Analysis

## Current State

### Issue 1: Status Validations Not Being Applied
The `StatusValidations` class exists but is not being called in the main processing flow:
- Imported in `cy_advance_analysis.py` but methods are never invoked
- Similar validations are implemented separately in `DOAdvanceAnalysisProcessor`
- These validations are not appearing in the output files

### Issue 2: DO Advance Analysis Not Running
The DO advance analysis processing (which includes CY/PY merge and validations) is not being executed because:
- The process fails earlier at the "Obligation Analysis" sheet modification
- The error "Required sheets not found" prevents the DO processing from running

### Issue 3: Missing Merge Sample Logging
The CY/PY merge happens in `_merge_dataframes()` but wasn't logging sample data.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Merge Logging
Updated `do_advance_analysis_processing.py` to log:
```python
# Sample of merged data (first 5 rows)
# Shows DO Concatenate, Status, Advance/Prepayment from both CY and PY
# Merge statistics showing match rate
```

### 2. Status Validations Integration Needed
To properly apply status validations, the code needs to:

1. **In the main processing flow**, after basic transformations:
```python
# Add this after perform_checks() in cy_advance_analysis.py
df = self.status_validations.add_advances_requiring_explanations(df)
df = self.status_validations.add_null_or_blank_columns(df)
df = self.status_validations.add_advance_date_after_pop_expiration(df)
# ... etc for all validation methods
```

2. **Or integrate the DO processing** into the main flow to ensure:
- CY and PY data are properly merged
- All validations are applied
- Results are saved to the output file

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Fix the "Required sheets not found" error** first so DO processing can run
2. **Integrate StatusValidations** into the main processing flow
3. **Ensure DO advance analysis results** are included in the final output
4. **Add checkpoints** to save intermediate results with validations

## Expected Output Columns After Full Integration

When properly integrated, the output should include these validation columns:
- Advances Requiring Explanations?
- Null or Blank Columns
- Advance Date After Expiration of PoP
- Status Changed?
- Anticipated Liquidation Date Test
- Anticipated Liquidation Date Delayed?
- Valid Status 1
- Valid Status 2
- DO Status 1 Validation
- DO Status 2 Validations
- DO Comment

## Sample Merge Output (When Working)

```
Sample of merged data (first 5 rows):
   DO Concatenate  Status  Advance/Prepayment  PY 4-Advance Analysis.Status  PY 4-Advance Analysis.Advance/Prepayment_1
0  700086148020    1       -242.18            1                             -242.18
1  700086148021    2       1000.00            2                             1000.00
...

Merge statistics: 5 rows matched with PY data out of 8 total rows
Match rate: 62.5%
