# Advance/Prepayment Column Fix

## Issue
The pivot table creation was failing because it was looking for a "UDO" column that doesn't exist in the "3-PY Q4 Ending Balance" sheet. The log showed that the actual column name is "Advance/Prepayment".

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Column Search in `create_pivot_table` Function
**File**: `src/advance_analysis/modules/excel_handler.py`

Changed from searching for "UDO" column to searching for "Advance/Prepayment" column:
- Now searches for columns containing both "advance" and "prepayment" (case-insensitive)
- Removed the complex pivot table creation logic
- Simplified to always create a SUM formula for the Advance/Prepayment column

### 2. Simplified Sum Calculation
Instead of trying to create a pivot table, the code now:
- Finds the Advance/Prepayment column
- Creates a simple SUM formula in cell I[header_row+1]
- Labels the column as "Total Advance/Prepayment"
- Applies currency formatting

### 3. Removed UDO-Specific Logic
- Removed the condition that excluded "UDO" columns when finding the last row
- Removed the complex pivot table field manipulation code
- Simplified error handling

### 4. Fixed Unused Variable Warning
Added a comment to indicate that `sum_udo_balance_col2` is reserved for future use in the `validate_udo_tier_recon` function.

## Benefits

1. **Simpler Code**: Removed complex pivot table logic in favor of a straightforward SUM formula
2. **More Reliable**: Direct column search and sum calculation is less error-prone
3. **Better Error Messages**: Clear logging shows which column is being used
4. **Matches Data Structure**: Uses the actual column name from the Excel file

## Example Log Output
```
Searching for Advance/Prepayment column...
Found Advance/Prepayment column at index 5 (column E): 'Advance/Prepayment'
Created sum formula for Advance/Prepayment in cell $I$7
```

## Next Steps
1. Test with actual Excel files to verify the sum calculation works correctly
2. Monitor logs to ensure the Advance/Prepayment column is consistently found
3. Consider adding fallback logic for files with different column naming conventions
