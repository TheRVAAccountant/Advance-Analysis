# Excel File Save Fix

## Issue
When errors occurred during Excel processing, the output file wasn't being saved with the completed operations. The log showed operations being performed (pivot table creation, sheet copying, etc.), but these changes weren't visible in the output file because:

1. The `input_wb.Save()` was only called at the end if ALL operations completed successfully
2. In the `finally` block, workbooks were closed with `SaveChanges=False`, discarding any unsaved changes

## Root Cause
In the `process_excel_files` function:
- Line 768: `input_wb.Save()` - Only executed if no errors occur
- Line 785: `wb.Close(SaveChanges=False)` - Always executed, discarding changes if not saved

## Solution
Implemented two key fixes:

### 1. Save in Finally Block
Modified the `finally` block to always save the input workbook before closing:
```python
finally:
    # Save the input workbook if it was modified
    if input_wb:
        try:
            logger.info("Saving input workbook before closing...")
            input_wb.Save()
            logger.info("Input workbook saved successfully")
        except Exception as save_error:
            logger.error(f"Error saving input workbook: {str(save_error)}")
```

### 2. Intermediate Saves
Added saves after major operations to preserve partial progress:
- After copying sheets
- After creating pivot table
- After creating tickmarks

## Benefits

1. **Partial Progress Saved**: Even if the process fails partway through, completed operations are saved
2. **Error Recovery**: Users can see what was completed before the error occurred
3. **Better Debugging**: Output files show the actual state when errors happen
4. **Data Integrity**: No loss of completed work due to errors in subsequent operations

## Log Output

Now you'll see intermediate save messages:
```
Saved workbook after copying sheets
Saved workbook after pivot table creation
Saved workbook after tickmark creation
Saving input workbook before closing...
Input workbook saved successfully
```

## Error Handling

If saving fails at any point:
- A warning is logged for intermediate saves (process continues)
- An error is logged for the final save in the finally block
- The file state reflects the last successful save

## Result

Now when you open the output file after an error, you'll see:
- All sheets that were successfully copied
- The pivot table if it was created
- Tickmarks if they were added
- Any other operations completed before the error

This ensures that users can see the progress made and potentially identify what caused the failure by examining the partially completed file.
