DO Note:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Due to system limitations related to the FSMS transition, CG's Obligation Validation system has been unable to communicate with FSMS preventing CG from being able to track a complete population of open obligations. FY23 Q2 was the first period CG was able to use it's new Obligation Validation Tool OOMAT to populate the obligation analysis. As of FY24 Q4, CGs implementation of this tool has provided improvements to the overall Obligation Management process. CG expects see additional progress in FY25.

As a result of the DO review, the following observations were observed:

Status 1 - There were a total of 70,292 Status 1 Obligations:
- 15,007 are missing one or more required fields as a result of issues with how the data comes across in the Component Financial Hub from NESSS or ALMIS
- 2,451 had obligation dates that exceeded the end of the Period of Performance
- 34,233 had comments that do not address the cause of the abnormal balance
- 35,195 reported no invoice activity
- 33,649 were identified as Valid Status 1 Obligations
- 226 contained comments stating unresolved issues or requiring additional research

Status 2 - No Status 2 Obligations were reported in FY24 Q4.

Status 3 - There were a total of 55,150 Status 3 Obligations. Of these, the following exceptions were noted:
- De-obligation dates were not provided for the majority of obligations
- 13,586 are missing one or more required fields
- 34,318 had comments that do not address the cause of the abnormal balance with no invoice activity reported
- 4,166 reported no invoice activity
- Multiple obligations had de-obligation dates in the prior year

Status 4 - There were a total of 4,125 Status 4 Obligations. Of these, the following exceptions were noted:
- De-obligation dates were not provided for the majority
- 950 are missing one or more required fields  
- 1,347 obligations had de-obligation dates in the prior year
- 421 reported no invoice activity
- 234 are missing one or more fields

Component Response Summary:

The component provided explanations for the identified issues:

1. Missing Fields: The vast majority of missing Period of Performance end dates, last invoice dates, and PY Q4 Ending Balances are from ALMIS and NESSS systems which do not transmit this data. This is also due to migration from FPD/CAS where dates were not brought over.

2. Obligation Dates After PoP End: Several reasons including Antecedent Liabilities, Suspense Reduction efforts, and corrections from quantity based to amount based. Although obligation document numbers and dates are within FY24, the accounting information or POET information is from prior years.

3. Abnormal Balances: These are known issues that would be better addressed by CG-84 and the FINCEN GL Team regarding correction timelines.

4. De-obligation Backlogs: The component acknowledged a significant backlog of de-obligations due to numerous issues including the FSMS transition and migration issues, latency issues and unreliable data, and the lack of a validation system for almost two years, resulting in ongoing catch-up efforts.

5. Status Misclassifications: The component confirmed that 28 obligations erroneously categorized as Status 1 should have been Status 3, as most were prior year travel obligations that should be paid out with any remainder de-obligated. Additionally, approximately 19 obligations ($475K) in Status 3/4 with comments mentioning "still needed" or "being researched" should likely be Status 1.

6. Validation Process: The component noted they have approximately 300K open obligations between PY & CY across all risk categories. They mitigate validation errors through Open Obligation monthly non-statistical and quarterly statistical testing to identify and correct mistakes.

The DO will continue to monitor the status of CG's ability to validate their obligations through meetings and future reviews of the analysis.
