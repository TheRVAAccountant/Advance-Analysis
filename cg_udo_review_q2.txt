DO Note:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Due to system limitations related to the FSMS transition, CG's Obligation Validation system has been unable to communicate with FSMS preventing CG from being able to track a complete population of open obligations. FY23 Q2 was the first period CG was able to use it's new Obligation Validation Tool OOMAT to populate the obligation analysis. As of FY24 Q4, CGs implementation of this tool has provided improvements to the overall Obligation Management process.  CG expects see additional progress in FY25.

The DO reached out to the component concerning the cause of the abnormal balances in several obligations included in the population and the issues included the following: 
1. Data migration where the original funding was captured by a JV but not at the transactional level
2. Posting logic issues where related to advance payments and some receipting functions cause abnormal balances
3. Issues with the Financial Accounting Hub (FAH) where during some accounting periods the link between NESSS/ALMIS and FSMS wasn’t transmitting transactions correctly so many were recorded via JVs and can’t trace back to transactional level records at the GL
4. Other issues we don’t know aboutThe DO will continue to monitor the status of CGs ability to validate their obligations through meetings and future reviews of the analysis. See attached email.
See additional attached email below for additional follow-up items the DO was unable to receive a response for related to missing fields, Status of UDOs under DCAA audit, Stale Obligations, comments that don't align with the status reported for obligations and Obligations where the Date of the Obligation exceeds the end of the PoP end date.
