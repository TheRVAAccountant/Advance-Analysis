DO Note:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        WMD continues to manage their obligation portfolio while facing staffing challenges due to the hiring freeze. CWMD has had to divert resources that were normally fully dedicated to de-obligation activities to other competing priorities. Despite these challenges, the component remains committed to de-obligating funds before they reach cancellation status.

As a result of the DO review for FY25 Q2, the following observations were observed:

Status 1 - Observations noted:
- 66 Obligations in canceling funds totaling $7,434,883.56 (53 of which are Inactive Obligations totaling $5,966,830.61)
- 1,011 obligations missing one or more required fields
- 470 Obligations with de-obligation dates provided requiring validation of Status 1 designation

Status 2 - There were 114 Status 2 Obligations with the following exceptions:
- 113 obligations missing one or more required fields

Status 3 - Observations noted:

- 117 Obligations missing de-obligation dates totaling $10,444,427.75

Component Response Summary:

WMD provided the following clarifications for the identified issues:

1. Obligations in Canceling Funds (Status 1): WMD is working diligently to de-obligate these funds before cancellation. Due to being already understaffed when the hiring freeze took effect, CWMD has had to divert resources that were normally fully dedicated to this objective to other competing priorities. It remains their goal to have these funds de-obligated prior to cancellation on September 30, 2025.

2. Status 1 Obligations with De-obligation Dates: WMD confirmed that the 470 obligations with de-obligation dates provided are valid Status 1 obligations.

3. Status 2 Obligation with De-obligation Date: The obligation with de-obligation date and comments stating "submitted to OPO" remains a valid Status 2 as OPO is still working on the de-obligation and it is not yet complete.

4. Status 3 and 4 Obligations in Canceling Funds: WMD confirmed that these obligations have been submitted for de-obligation and OPO is still working on processing them. The de-obligation dates are to be determined (TBD).

5. Missing Fields and Documentation: The component did not provide specific responses regarding the significant number of obligations missing required fields or comments across all status categories.

The DO will continue to monitor WMD's progress in addressing the de-obligation backlog, particularly for obligations in canceling funds, and the completion of required data fields across their obligation portfolio. Special attention will be given to the impact of staffing constraints on the component's ability to meet de-obligation deadlines.
