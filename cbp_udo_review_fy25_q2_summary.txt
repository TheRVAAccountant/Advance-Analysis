DO Note:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        CBP continues to manage a significant population of open obligations while dealing with system limitations in their contract writing system (Procurement for Public Sector - PPS) and financial system (SAP). The component has been working to improve their obligation validation processes and address challenges related to period of performance tracking at the line-item level.

As a result of the DO review for FY25 Q2, the following observations were observed:

Status 1 - There were a total of 49,740 Status 1 Obligations:
- 48,501 were identified as Valid Status 1 Obligations with reasonable comments
- 989 were stale obligations (inactive with no invoice activity within last 12 months and expired PoP) with reasonable comments
- 250 require follow-up, including:
  - 164 stale obligations where comments may not be current (obligation date exceeds six months)
  - 27 obligations where the obligation date exceeds the expiration of the Period of Performance
  - 31 active obligations with invoice activity where CBP's determination of Status 1 requires clarification
  - 28 inactive obligations where CBP's Status 1 determination requires clarification

Status 2 - There were a total of 798 Status 2 Obligations:
- 759 were identified as having reasonable comments (active and inactive obligations)
- 39 require follow-up regarding how CBP determines Status 2 designation, including:
  - 11 active obligations with invoice activity
  - 27 inactive obligations without recent invoice activity
  - 1 obligation reported under DCAA audit (which should not be Status 2)

Status 3 - There were a total of 3,363 Status 3 Obligations:
- 2,948 were identified as Valid Status 3 Obligations with reasonable de-obligation dates
- 415 had de-obligation dates delayed by 365 days or more requiring explanation

Status 4 - There were a total of 1,506 Status 4 Obligations:
- 541 were identified as Valid Status 4 Obligations with reasonable de-obligation dates
- 964 had de-obligation dates delayed by 365 days or more requiring explanation
- 1 obligation was under DCAA audit with reasonable documentation

Component Response Summary:

CBP provided clarifications for the identified issues:

1. Period of Performance End Dates: This is a system limitation in both PPS and SAP. The date the line item is obligated becomes the period of performance start date; however, there is no period of performance end date at the line-item level. Currently, they pull the "end date with option years" from the header level of the obligation, not at the specific line-item level.

2. Status 2 Designations: Per the CRG, Status 2 is for obligations currently under review by a DHS office to determine validity. CBP's guidance to program offices has been to only use Status 2 if there was not sufficient time to review, research and follow up with other parties to determine the proper status. Any Status 2 obligation must have a date as to when a valid status will be provided, which cannot be past year-end.

3. Status 1 Determinations: Depending on the type of obligation, until the program office or warranted Contracting Officer determines the obligation is ready for close out and they have concurrence from the vendor, trading partner, and/or other DHS offices, the obligation line remains valid. If funding remains on the contract and the fund is not cancelling, CBP, the vendor and/or trading partner must concur that no pending invoices or adjustments are needed before they can agree it is no longer valid and proceed with de-obligation.

4. Status 2 for DCAA Audit: CBP acknowledged they will look into making a future system change to prevent a program office from selecting Status 2 if the obligation is under DCAA audit, as per the CRG requirements.

The DO will continue to monitor CBP's obligation management practices, particularly focusing on the timely resolution of de-obligations and the proper application of status designations in accordance with DHS guidance.
